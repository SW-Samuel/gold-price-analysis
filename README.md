# Gold Price Analysis with Transformers 🪙🤖📈

This repository contains data analysis and **forecasting models for gold price trends**, using **Transformer-based architectures** for time series prediction. The project focuses on **historical data exploration**, **technical indicators** (such as Bollinger Bands), and the application of **deep learning models** to forecast future gold prices.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze historical **gold price data**.
- Visualize trends, volatility, and market patterns.
- Apply technical indicators like **Bollinger Bands**.
- Develop and train **Transformer-based models** for time series forecasting.

---

## 🧠 About the Transformer Model

This project uses **deep learning architectures inspired by the Transformer model**, originally introduced for natural language processing, but adapted here for **time series forecasting tasks**.

Some features of the model:

- **Attention mechanisms** to capture long-term dependencies in the data.
- Works well on **multivariate time series**.
- Handles complex temporal patterns better than traditional statistical models.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 🐍
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / Numpy
- Matplotlib / Plotly
- Statsmodels (for baseline comparisons)

## 📈 Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Technical Indicators (Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages)
- Time Series Forecasting with **Transformer-based models**
- Model Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, etc.)
- Visualization of predictions vs actual data

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains **historical gold price data**, including daily open, high, low, close, and volume information.
